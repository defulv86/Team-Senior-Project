in this next section, the stimuli will look a little different.

00:03.310 --> 00:05.216 position:50% align:middle
Along with numerical stimuli, 

00:05.339 --> 00:10.635 position:50% align:middle
you will also be required to order alphabetical stimuli mixed in with the numerical stimuli.

00:10.845 --> 00:14.371 position:50% align:middle
The correct resulting order will be a combination of the two stimulus types

00:14.415 --> 00:20.603 position:50% align:middle
with numbers sorted in ascending order first, followed by the letters sorted in alphabetical order

00:21.016 --> 00:27.276 position:50% align:middle
In this example, the stimulus presented was 5, 8, H, 6, L.

00:27.566 --> 00:29.566 position:50% align:middle
Following the order presented earlier

00:29.657 --> 00:35.392 position:50% align:middle
the proper ordering of this stimulus would be 5, 6, 8, H, L.
