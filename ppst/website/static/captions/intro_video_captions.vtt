This test will consist of two main types of stimuli

00:10.237 --> 00:13.417 position:50% align:middle
The first section will consist of digit-only stimuli.

00:13.293 --> 00:16.855 position:50% align:middle
The second section will consist of mixed stimuli

00:16.984 --> 00:21.124 position:50% align:middle
A second video will cover how to respond to the mixed stimuli questions.

00:21.352 --> 00:26.129 position:50% align:middle
At the conclusion of this video, you'll be presented with two practice digit stimuli.

00:26.374 --> 00:29.925 position:50% align:middle
Don't worry, your results from this section will not be recorded.

00:30.113 --> 00:33.105 position:50% align:middle
It's just to get you comfortable with the format of the test.

00:33.348 --> 00:38.066 position:50% align:middle
Each practice question is an exact replication of what a real question will look like.

00:38.265 --> 00:43.903 position:50% align:middle
Each question will begin with the stimuli, in this case, the numbers being flashed on screen.

00:44.001 --> 00:48.326 position:50% align:middle
Once the last stimulus is presented, the main test screen will appear.

00:48.541 --> 00:53.291 position:50% align:middle
On this screen, you will be presented with tiles containing the stimuli that were presented to you, 

00:53.499 --> 00:55.835 position:50% align:middle
along with other miscellaneous stimuli.

00:56.046 --> 00:59.531 position:50% align:middle
You must memorize the stimuli that were presented and click on each 

00:59.665 --> 01:04.478 position:50% align:middle
corresponding tile with the goal of ending up with the tiles in sequential order.

01:04.637 --> 01:08.980 position:50% align:middle
Once you're finished with the practice questions, the real test will begin.
